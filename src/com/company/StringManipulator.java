    1. Initialize example string by this value -> "         this is an example string       "  (copy/paste whole string between "");

    2.Take new variable and call method trim() and assign value to new variable.

    3. Take new variable and call replace() with params "thi" and "w", then assign value to new variable.

    4. Take new variable and call replaceFirst() with params "n"  and "nn", then assign value to new variable.

    5. Take new variable and call replaceAll() with params "*s*a*\\s" (regex- regular expression) and "" (empty string). Assign value to new variable.

    6. Take new variable and call substring() form 0 ( java counts from '0' , 0 means "first index/beginning") to 5). Assign value to new variable.

    7.  Take new variable and call upper() form 0 ( java counts from '0' , 0 means "first index/beginning") to 5). Assign value to new variable.

    8.  Take new variable and call concat() with param ("R!!!"). Assign value to new variable.

    9. Print the last crated variable.

    10.Try to make the same sequentially calling methods one by one without breaking line and declaring new variables. Like ->  System.out.println(example.call()call(params).call().etc....call())

    Experiment with String class API ( Application Programming Interface-> means all methods shared by class, library, program...)
